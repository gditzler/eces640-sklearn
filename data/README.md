Obtaining the data
=======

The data was download from the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/) on 11/1/2013. In particular, we are interested in the [Caporaso Illumina time series study](ftp://thebeast.colorado.edu/pub/QIIME_DB_Public_Studies/study_550_split_library_seqs_and_mapping.zip). I have not changed the files. I downloaded the data and extracted the `biom` and `mapping` files for this demo. The original download on the EMP website has the sequence data, which is not needed for what we wish to demonstrate.
