# eces640-sklearn

This repository was put together for ECES640 at Drexel University. The purpose of this code is to: (a) demonstrate new software tools for pattern recognition and machine learning in Python, (b) demonstrate manipulations of biological data formats in Python, (c) implement basic multi-purpose modules, and (d) provide you with some code to accompony the lectures on dimensionality reduction.
